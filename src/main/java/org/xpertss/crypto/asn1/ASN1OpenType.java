/**
 * This type represents what was formerly called the ASN.1 ANY 
 * type. The ANY and ANY DEFINED BY types are superseded as of 
 * ITU-T Recommendation X.680 version current December 1997 by 
 * the ability to define type classes. Modelling type classes 
 * is beyond the scope of this ASN.1 package although the package 
 * can be enhanced accordingly. ASN.1 type classes can contain 
 * components whose type is unspecified. Such components are 
 * called &quot;open types&quot;. This class mimics an open 
 * type insofar as it decodes any type encountered in an encoded 
 * stream of ASN.1 types. On encoding the proper type is encoded 
 * in place of the open type. Decoding an open type that was not 
 * properly initialised either by a call to a creator with an 
 * argument or by decoding it from a valid ASN.1 encoding results 
 * in an {@link ASN1Null ASN1Null} being decoded.
 * <p>
 * This class enforces as an invariant that inner types have the 
 * same tagging as the type itself. For instance:
 * <blockquote><pre>
 * ASN1OpenType ot;
 * ASN1Integer n;
 *
 * n = new ASN1Integer("42");
 * n.setExplicit(true);
 *
 * ot = new ASN1OpenType(new FooResolver());
 * ot.setExplicit(false);
 * ot.setInnerType(n);
 * </pre></blockquote>
 * will cause the tagging method of <code>n</code> to be changed 
 * into EXPLICIT upon the call to <code>ot.setInnerType()</code>.
