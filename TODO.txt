TODO
  Test Maven Plugins
     Concurrency of Signing???
  Add README example of using Sun PKCS11 impl & test if possible
  Modify Integration Tests
     Use Apache jarsigner to sign and my signer to verify

For the trust store do I also need a storetype and storepass???
    Is it sufficiently safe for concurrency?

When it comes to certificate chain (or path) building I currently
 use the Issuer/Subject name chaining method. A better model might
 be to use the AuthorityKeyIdentifier and SubjectKeyIdentifier that
 are generally included as X509 Extensions.
